    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Howdy all! I live in North Decatur with my wife, two dogs and a cat. On most weekends you can find me hiking, climbing, kayaking or some other outdoor activity. I also enjoy speculative fiction, comics, board games and the occasional video game. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also a registered Profesitional Engineer. I have spent the last 12 years designing HVAC and plumbing systems for comercial buidlings. I decided I needed a bit of a change and look forward to learning to code with you all! 
    </p>
    <h3>Say Howdy!</h3>
